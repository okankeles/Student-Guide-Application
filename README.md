# Student-Guide-Application

The Student Guide Application is a Java-based project that manages student records using a doubly linked list. It reads student data from a text file (`ogrenciler.txt`) and allows for various operations such as adding, deleting, and searching for students. The application offers the following functionalities:

1. **Create a Doubly Linked List:** Initializes a doubly linked list in memory by reading from `ogrenciler.txt`.
2. **Add a Student:** Adds a new student to the list in the appropriate position based on their student number, with data entered via the keyboard.
3. **Search for Students:** Prints the information of a student (or all students with the same name and surname) based on the name and surname entered via the keyboard.
4. **Delete a Student:** Removes a student from the list based on their student number entered via the keyboard.
5. **Print All Records:** Displays all student records in ascending order, sorted by student number.
6. **Exit:** Closes the application.

This project provides a simple and efficient way to manage student records with basic CRUD operations and can be a useful tool for learning data structures in Java.
